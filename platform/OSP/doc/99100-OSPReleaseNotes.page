!!!Release 2015.1

!!Summary of Changes

  - OSP Web: WebServerDispatcher now consumes left over request data (e.g.,
    if a POST request with data is sent to a handler only accepting GET. Previously,
    the next request would fail as leftover data from POST body would spill into
    next request).
  - OSP Auth: When authenticating a user via LDAP fails, the user is removed from the local
    user database, as authentication failure can also mean that the user no longer
    exists. Furthermore, LDAP attribute names are now case insensitive.

    (com.appinf.osp.shell.commands).
  - OSP Shell: Help command now has aliases 'h' and '?' and also supports
    "help <command>" syntax.
  - OSP Core: Code cache is automatically updated with latest shared libraries if a new

  - The OSP web server can now be disabled through the configuration by
    specifying a port number of 0.
  - Poco::OSP::ServiceRegistry::unregisterService() now checks for a null ServiceRef.

    and path for the session cookie.

!!Known Issues

  - None at this time.

!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

!!!Release 2011.1

!!Summary of Changes

  - Added Visual Studio project and solution files for 64-bit builds on Visual Studio
    2008 and 2010.
  - Added basic iOS support to OSP (enabled by compiling OSP with -DPOCO_OSP_STATIC).
    This allows for static registration of bundle activators. This way, parts of
    OSP can also be used on platforms that don't support dynamic loading
    of shared libraries (such as iOS).
  - Poco::OSP::Web::WebSessionManager: it is now possible to control the domain and
    path of the session cookie by including them in the appName (e.g.,
    myCookie@.mydomain.com/path).
  - Added Crypto bundle for deploying POCO Crypto library.
  - OSP Shell services command now supports --properties option to print service
    properties.
  - OSP Web Server: if a request handler factory now returns a 0 pointer instead of a
    proper request handler instance, a 404 error is reported.
  - OSP Web Server: added Poco::OSP::Web::WebServerService. Subclasses of this class
    are registered by the standard web server and secure web server bundles and can
    be used to find port numbers and server params of running web servers.
  - Web Index bundle no longer responds to arbitrary request URIs, only / and
    /index.html (fixes a potential security issue where a request for a
    non-existing path would automatically resolve to the Web Index bundle, even
    if it's not meant to be shown).
  - Web Info bundle now displays additional information and uses Poco::Net::NetworkInterface
    class instead of DNS to enumerate IP addresses (fixes exception with embedded
    systems that lack proper DNS configuration).
  - Added convenience methods getValue() and setValue() to Poco::OSP::Web::WebSession.
  - ServiceRegistry: when registering or unregistering a service, the lock on the
    registry is now released before the corresponding event is fired.
    This allows registration or deregistration of services from within the event
    handler. Previously, this would cause a deadlock.
  - Added Poco::OSP::ServiceFinder utility class template.
  - BundleCreator: added support for extension bundles.
  - OSP: added support for extension bundles.
  - The path(list) passed to BundleRepository can now include wildcard,
    as well as direct paths to bundles.

!!Known Issues

!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

  - OSP BundleCreator now fully supports variable expansion in bundle spec file

  - fixed #0000099: Poco::OSP::Service::type() and isA()

!!Known Issues

  - None at this time.

!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

  - The Remoting bundles have been renamed from poco.remoting.* to
    com.appinf.remoting.* as poco.* is now strictly reserved for
    bundles related to the open source POCO C++ Libraries.
    If you have dependencies on Remoting bundles in your bundles,
    please change the bundle names accordingly. Also, make sure to
    remove the old poco.remoting bundles from your bundle repositories.


!!!Release 2009.1

!!Summary of Changes

  - Based on POCO C++ Libraries 1.3.5
  - Bundles now have a numeric ID, valid and guaranteed
    to be unique during the runtime of the containing
    application. The ID of a bundle can be obtained
    with the id() member function.
  - New OSP Command Shell Service, allows for command-line
    based management of OSP applications. The shell can
    also be extended with custom commands.
  - Added OSPBundleSign library, which provides support
    for cryptographically signing bundles, as well as for

  - fixed OSP shared library names to match naming conventions
  - Stopping a Remoting Transport bundle (such as poco.remoting.binary or poco.remoting.soap)
    before stopping the Remoting bundle will no longer
    crash the application, due to insufficient cleanup when unloading the transport library.
